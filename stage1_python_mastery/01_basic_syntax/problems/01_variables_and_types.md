# Problem: Variables and Data Types

## Description
Create a Python program that demonstrates the use of different data types and variables in Python.

## Requirements
1. Create variables of different types:
   - Integer
   - Float
   - String
   - Boolean
   - List
   - Dictionary
   - Tuple
   - Set

2. Perform basic operations on these variables:
   - Arithmetic operations on numbers
   - String concatenation and formatting
   - List operations (append, remove, etc.)
   - Dictionary operations (add, remove, update)
   - Set operations (union, intersection)

3. Print the results of all operations

## Example Output
```
Integer operations: 15
Float operations: 7.5
String operations: Hello, World!
Boolean operations: True
List operations: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Dictionary operations: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
Tuple operations: (1, 2, 3)
Set operations: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding Python's basic data types
- Variable declaration and assignment
- Basic operations on different data types
- Type conversion
- String formatting

## Hints
1. Use the `type()` function to check variable types
2. Remember that Python is dynamically typed
3. Use f-strings for string formatting
4. Be careful with mutable vs immutable types
