# Daily Python Practice

This directory contains my daily Python practice problems and solutions. Each day's work is organized in its own directory with the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Daily Practice Structure

Each day's practice directory contains:
- `problem.md`: Description of the problem(s) solved
- `solution.py`: Python implementation
- `README.md`: Explanation of the solution and learning outcomes

## Sample Daily Entry

### 2024-03-06
- Problem: Implement a binary search algorithm
- Focus: Data Structures and Algorithms
- Learning Outcomes: Understanding of binary search, time complexity analysis

## Progress Tracking

| Date | Topic | Problems Solved | Key Learnings |
|------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| 2024-03-06 | Binary Search | 1 | Time complexity, array manipulation |

## Daily Goals

1. Solve at least one coding problem
2. Document the solution and approach
3. Analyze time and space complexity
4. Write clean, well-documented code
5. Include test cases
