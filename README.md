# Python for AI Practice - Maneesh Bommakanti

Welcome to my dedicated repository for practicing Python, with a specific focus on its applications in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This space serves as a living journal of my learning journey, a sandbox for experimentation, and a portfolio showcasing my developing skills in the field. I am committed to consistent practice and building meaningful projects, documenting my progress along the way.

## Purpose and Goals

The primary goal of this repository is to systematically build and demonstrate proficiency in Python for AI/ML. This includes:
- Mastering core Python concepts
- Becoming adept with essential libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Implementing various algorithms
- Undertaking end-to-end AI projects
