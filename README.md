# Python for AI Practice - Maneesh Bommakanti

Welcome to my dedicated repository for practicing Python, with a specific focus on its applications in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I want to build Robots such as iron man or his hand, wall-e.

## Purpose and Goals

The primary goal of this repository is to systematically build and demonstrate proficiency in Python for AI/ML. This includes:
- Mastering core Python concepts
- Becoming adept with essential libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Implementing various algorithms
- Undertaking end-to-end AI projects

## Repository Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ learning_resources/ # Notes and learning materials
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt   # Project dependencies
```

## Daily Practice

I commit to practicing Python for 3 hours daily, focusing on:

My roadmap is simple: Each "‚úÖ" is represented as the topic i have completed
